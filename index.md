I am a Ph.D. Student in department of Mechanical Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with a focus on machining and measurement. I conduct research in Prof. Kai TANG's Lab, where I investigate hydrothermal systems in many different locals from marine, terrestrial, and extra-terrestrial! My research interests include geothermal heat flux in porous and fractured media, use of analytical mathematics to solve complex hydrologic issues, and implementation of near-surface geophysical techniques to better inform hydrologic models.

Please take a look through my site and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would be interested in working together!
